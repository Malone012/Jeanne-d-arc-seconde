			<h1>III)History of Fission and Fusion:</h1>

			<h2>1)Fission:</h2>

			<big>
				<p>-In December 1938, in Berlin, Otto HAHN and Fritz STRASSMAN bombarded a sample of uranium with neutrons, hoping to create a new chemical element. But the result was not as expected. <br>A year later, it was discovered that when the uranium-235 atom absorbs the neutron, it becomes so incredibly unstable that it "splits" or "splits" into fragments. This is called nuclear fission.</p>
			</big>
				<br>
				<br>
			<h3>2)Fusion:</h3>
			
			<big>
				<p>-In the 1920s, when the physicist Aston discovered, by studying the mass defect of helium, that it was possible to recover a large quantity of energy by manufacturing a helium nucleus from lighter elements. <br><br>Following this discovery, the English astronomer EDDIGTON suggests that the energy of stars comes from a reaction of nuclear fusion. It was then that he put forward the idea of learning to control this energy in order to be able to use it for his own purposes.<br><br>It will be necessary to wait until the end of the Second World War for an international motivation for controlled thermonuclear fusion to emerge. Thus begins the series of creation of tokamak (fusion reactors) all over the world. Thus, the first reactor patents were filed in London. Thomson and Blackman invent one of the very first reactors, its concept is certainly quite ambitious for the time but it already has a toric-shaped vacuum chamber, which is an important aspect found on current tokamaks.</p>

				<h4>IV)Energy aspects of nuclear transformations:</h4>
			</center>
			
			<big>
				<p>-In 1905, Albert EINSTEIN established a relationship between mass and energy, with his famous formula:<i>E=mc</i>
				<sup>2</sup></p>
				<br>
				<p>-With E in joule (energy), m in kilogram (mass) and c=299,792,458 m/s (i.e. the speed of light).</p>
				<br>
				<p>-The principle is the same for fusion and nuclear fission. Indeed, fusion and fission are accompanied by a loss of mass released in the form of energy during a nuclear transformation. These transformations are called exothermic.</p>
				<br>
				<p>-But there is a difference between the energy released by power plants and the energy released by fusion. Indeed, the energy produced by fission is converted into electronic energy in power plants and the energy produced by fusion in the heart of stars is converted into light energy.</p>
